This is my first CRUD application. A CRUD application is an applicationt that can Create, Read, Use, and Delete information. I used both HTML and JavaScript to create a simple application that takes user input (First Name, Last Name, and Phone Number). It stores this data, and the data can be deleted or edited by the user.

Through this project, I learned numerous skills such as:

**Form Handling:** I gained experience in capturing form data and preventing default form submission behaviors using event.preventDefault().

**DOM Manipulation:** I learned how to dynamically create and insert table rows based on user input using JavaScript's createElement() and appendChild() methods.

**String Interpolation:** I applied template literals (backticks) in JavaScript to dynamically generate HTML content, making it easier to insert user data into the table.

**Event Listeners:** I practiced using addEventListener() to handle user actions, such as submitting the form, deleting a row, or editing existing data.

**State Management: **I explored how to track and manage the application's state, such as by using a variable like selectedRow to keep track of which table row is being edited.

**Alert Messages:** I added feedback to the user by displaying alert messages after actions like adding, editing, or deleting data.

**Bootstrap Integration: **I enhanced the UI by integrating Bootstrap for styling the form, table, and buttons.

This project was very helpful for me to learn how to create interactive web applications using front-end technologies. In the future I hope to use this information to create a larger application that can utilize the login functions that were started in this application.
